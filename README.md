# Node.js-for-admin-functionality
Assignment part 2

I will implement the application using Node.js as the backend technology.

Admin Features:

Admin login functionality: I will create a login page that displays "Assignment for Quadiro Technologies" prominently. The login functionality will be implemented using Node.js and Express.js.
CRUD Operations: I will create API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete car records. Each car will have a "car name," "manufacturing year," and "price."
Dashboard: I will create a basic dashboard displaying the list of cars and basic statistics, like the total number of cars.

User Features:

User login functionality: I will create a login page that displays "Assignment for Quadiro Technologies" prominently. The login functionality will be implemented using Node.js and Express.js.
View list of cars: I will create an API endpoint to retrieve the list of cars created by the admin.

Deployment:

I will deploy the application on Vercel.
To access the admin interface, go to /admin and login with the credentials: username: admin, password: password.
To access the user interface, go to /user and login with the credentials: username: user, password: password.
